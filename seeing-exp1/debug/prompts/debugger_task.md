You are the debugger for a MuJoCo scene another agent, the builder, wrote from this brief:

<brief>
{brief}
</brief>

The brief's causal chain, one link per line, in order:

{chain}

The scene has been run for {seconds} s. Here is what holds now:

{status}

The builder's file, with line numbers:

<file>
{file}
</file>

Your job: find out why the first broken link fails and what change to the file would make it hold without breaking a
link that holds now, and without departing from the brief. The builder will read your report and decide what to
change; you do not edit the file.

You can ask questions of the run. Put them in one ```ask block, one per line, up to four per reply:

- `why <k>`: when link k was lost, the touches that led there, and the file lines that set them up
- `forks <k>`: every number on the lines behind link k changed alone (to 1.1, 0.9, 1.5 and 0.5 times itself), each
  run judged on the whole chain; it says which changes move the first break forward and which lose a link
- `try <line> <old text> => <new text>`: run a change you propose (several separated by ` ;; `) and judge the chain
- `watch <thing> <from s> <to s>`: where a thing is, how fast it moves and what it touches over a window
- `status`: the chain again

A fork that makes a link hold by changing a number the brief states (a size, an angle, a gap, a mass) is tuning, not a
fix: name the real fault instead. Check a fix with `try` before you report it. You have {turns} replies with questions;
then, or as soon as you know, end with one ```report block for the builder: what goes wrong, at what time, why (with
the evidence you checked), and the change you recommend with what `try` showed it does to every link.

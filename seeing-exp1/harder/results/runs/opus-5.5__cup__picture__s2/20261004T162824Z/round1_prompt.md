Here is a MuJoCo MJCF scene written for this brief:

<brief>
a ball rolls down a ramp and comes to rest in a cup
</brief>

MuJoCo loads the file, resets to the keyframe named `start` if there is one, and simulates it for 6 s.
Nothing else acts on the scene: whatever moves is set moving by the scene itself, for example by a keyframe
velocity, a spring, gravity, or a motor whose control the keyframe sets.

It follows a few conventions so the other tools can find things. They fix names and axes, not what is built:

- SI units. z is up. The floor's top surface is at z = 0, and the floor is a plane geom named `floor`.
- The ball is a body named `ball` with a `<freejoint/>` and one sphere geom named `ball`. Every geom of the ramp is named with the prefix `ramp`. The cup is a body named `cup`; all its geoms belong to it.
- Only primitive geom types: plane, sphere, capsule, cylinder, box, ellipsoid. No meshes, textures,
  `<default>` classes or `<include>`.
- Every body and geom has a name, and each element's attributes are on a single line.
- `<option timestep="0.002"/>`.

If you send a corrected file, keep these conventions.


MuJoCo ran the scene for 6 s from its start. Here is a picture of what happened.

How the picture was made. A dot renderer drew the run: every surface is covered in small dark dots on a
white ground, shaded only by surface normal against one light from above; dots on surfaces facing away from
the viewer are hidden. Everything that moved is drawn as residue: a copy of it every 0.15 s from the start
to 3.48 s, older copies lighter, the last darkest. Everything that did not move is drawn once.

The picture is a drafting view: two orthographic views stacked, with no perspective, sharing one scale of
33.31 pixels per metre, so x lines up between them. A thin gray rule separates them.
- Top band, side elevation, looking along +y: x runs left to right from -0.38 to 3.46 m, z runs up from
  -0.37 to 1.46 m.
- Bottom band, plan, looking down: x runs left to right over the same range, y runs up the page from -1.01
  to 1.01 m.

The image is 128x128 pixels: a box-filtered grayscale downsample of the 512x512 rendering, so each of
its pixels averages 4x4 pixels of the original.

Does the world do what the brief says? First describe what you see happen. Then end your reply with a ```json block
holding one object:

{"what_happens": "<what you see happen>", "works": <true or false>, "problem": "<one sentence, or empty>"}

If it does not work, also reply with the complete corrected file in one ```xml block, keeping the names the
brief needs. If it works, no file is needed.
